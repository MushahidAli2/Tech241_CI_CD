# CI/CD Presentation

## Introduction

- **What is CI/CD?**
  - CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It is a software development approach that focuses on automating the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.
- **What is CI/CD/CD (Continuous Deployment)?**
  - Continuous Deployment is an extension of CI/CD that involves automatically deploying applications to production environments after passing through the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Difference between CD and CDE (Continuous Delivery Engineering)**
  - Continuous Delivery Engineering refers to the practice of engineering and optimizing CI/CD pipelines to ensure reliable and efficient software delivery. It encompasses the tools, practices, and processes used to achieve continuous delivery.
- **Benefits of CI/CD**
  - Faster and more frequent releases
  - Reduced manual errors and increased reliability
  - Early detection of bugs and issues
  - Improved collaboration and communication among team members

## CI/CD Environment and How it Works

A CI/CD environment refers to the infrastructure and tools set up to implement the CI/CD approach in software development. It includes a combination of tools, processes, and resources that enable continuous integration, continuous testing, and continuous deployment of software applications.

CI/CD environment combines automation, version control, testing, and deployment tools to streamline the software development lifecycle, ensuring faster delivery of high-quality applications.

1. **Code** - Developers write code for the application.
2. **Commit** - Developers commit their code changes to a version control system (e.g., Git).
3. **Build** - The CI/CD system automatically builds the application, compiling the code and creating an executable or deployable artifact.
4. **Test** - Automated tests are run to check the quality and functionality of the application.
5. **Deploy** - If all tests pass, the application is deployed to a staging environment for further testing and validation.
6. **Release** - Once the application is approved in the staging environment, it is released to production, making it available to users.


## Git Workflow Diagram


![gitdiagram(1).png](images%2Fgitdiagram%281%29.png)
In this diagram:

- `Working Directory`: This is the area where you make changes to your files.
- `Staging Area`: Git allows you to selectively choose which changes to include in the next commit. You can add specific files or changes to the staging area.
- `Local Repository`: After staging the changes, you can create a commit, which takes a snapshot of the files in the staging area and stores it in your local repository.
- `Remote Repository`: This is the central repository that acts as a shared location for collaboration. You can push your local commits to the remote repository or pull the latest changes from it.
## Jenkins

- **What is Jenkins?**
  - Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables continuous integration and delivery. It provides a platform for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- **How does Jenkins work?**
  - Jenkins integrates with version control systems like Git to monitor code changes. It triggers build jobs, runs tests, and deploys applications based on predefined workflows and configurations.
- **Jenkins workflow**
  - Jenkins follows a pipeline-based workflow, where each stage represents a specific task, such as building, testing, or deploying. It allows teams to define and automate their CI/CD processes.

## SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

- **What is SDLC?**
  - SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a framework that defines the processes and activities involved in developing software applications.
- **SDLC Workflow Stages**
  1. Requirements Gathering
     - Identify and gather project requirements from stakeholders and end-users.
  2. Design and Planning
     - Create a detailed plan for the application, including architecture, user interface, and data structures.
  3. Development
     - Write code and develop the application based on the requirements and design.
  4. Testing
     - Perform various testing activities, such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, to ensure the application functions correctly.
  5. Deployment
     - Package and deploy the application to the production environment, making it available to users.
  6. Monitoring and Maintenance
     - Continuously monitor the application's performance and address any issues or bugs that arise. Regularly update and maintain the application.
