# CI/CD Presentation

## Introduction

- **What is CI/CD?**
  - CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It is a software development approach that focuses on automating the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.
- **What is CI/CD/CD (Continuous Deployment)?**
  - Continuous Deployment is an extension of CI/CD that involves automatically deploying applications to production environments after passing through the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Difference between CD and CDE (Continuous Delivery Engineering)**
  - Continuous Delivery Engineering refers to the practice of engineering and optimizing CI/CD pipelines to ensure reliable and efficient software delivery. It encompasses the tools, practices, and processes used to achieve continuous delivery.
- **Benefits of CI/CD**
  - Faster and more frequent releases
  - Reduced manual errors and increased reliability
  - Early detection of bugs and issues
  - Improved collaboration and communication among team members

## Jenkins

- **What is Jenkins?**
  - Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables continuous integration and delivery. It provides a platform for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- **How does Jenkins work?**
  - Jenkins integrates with version control systems like Git to monitor code changes. It triggers build jobs, runs tests, and deploys applications based on predefined workflows and configurations.
- **Jenkins workflow**
  - Jenkins follows a pipeline-based workflow, where each stage represents a specific task, such as building, testing, or deploying. It allows teams to define and automate their CI/CD processes.

## SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

- **What is SDLC?**
  - SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a framework that defines the processes and activities involved in developing software applications.
- **SDLC Workflow Stages**
  1. Requirements Gathering
     - Identify and gather project requirements from stakeholders and end-users.
  2. Design and Planning
     - Create a detailed plan for the application, including architecture, user interface, and data structures.
  3. Development
     - Write code and develop the application based on the requirements and design.
  4. Testing
     - Perform various testing activities, such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, to ensure the application functions correctly.
  5. Deployment
     - Package and deploy the application to the production environment, making it available to users.
  6. Monitoring and Maintenance
     - Continuously monitor the application's performance and address any issues or bugs that arise. Regularly update and maintain the application.
